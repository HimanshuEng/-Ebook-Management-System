**🎯 Architecture: MVC Pattern**

This project is built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture:

Model: Java classes (User, Cart, BookDtls, etc.) that represent data and business logic. Hibernate handles ORM (Object Relational Mapping) and database operations.

View: JSP pages (index.jsp, login.jsp, cart.jsp, etc.) render the UI and receive data via JSTL and EL.

Controller: Java Servlets (LoginServlet, CartController, UpdateProfile, etc.) handle incoming requests, process them using the Model, and forward results to Views.
